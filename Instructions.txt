Hello Sandeep
Thankyou once again.
I have made this project keeping in mind that it deals with habits , like reading books , baking cakes , so for such events how I have defined frequency is , as a target , i.e , target=8 means he plans to read 8 books or bake 8 cakes.You can update each day if you did that habit. You can check rewards in reward page. Create habit too.

Instructions
1)open the folder HabitBuilder in VS Code or any editor you like.
2)npm install
3)npm run install-client ( incase it doesnt work , type cd habit-builder-animall and then npm install )
4)npm run dev

It has google authentication added now
Port 3000 and 5000 is used.
Let me know your valuable feedback.
Feel free to email, whatsapp or call me. 
Thankyou
Anurag
